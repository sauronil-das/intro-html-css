    <h1>Halloween History For You To Sound Smart At The Comming Party!</h1>
    <h4><a href="https://www.history.com/topics/halloween/history-of-halloween"></a>Source From History Channel</a></h4>
    <p>Halloween&#39s origins date back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain (pronounced sow-in). The Celts, who lived 
        2,000 years ago, mostly in the area that is now Ireland, the United Kingdom and northern France, celebrated their 
        new year on November 1.

        This day marked the end of summer and the harvest and the beginning of the dark, cold winter, a time of year that was 
        often associated with human death. Celts believed that on the night before the new year, the boundary between the 
        worlds of the living and the dead became blurred. On the night of October 31 they celebrated Samhain, when it was 
        believed that the ghosts of the dead returned to earth.
        
        In addition to causing trouble and damaging crops, Celts thought that the presence of the otherworldly spirits made 
        it easier for the Druids, or Celtic priests, to make predictions about the future. For a people entirely dependent on 
        the volatile natural world, these prophecies were an important source of comfort during the long, dark winter.
        
        To commemorate the event, Druids built huge sacred bonfires, where the people gathered to burn crops and animals as 
        sacrifices to the Celtic deities. During the celebration, the Celts wore costumes, typically consisting of animal 
        heads and skins, and attempted to tell each other&#39ss fortunes.
        
        When the celebration was over, they re-lit their hearth fires, which they had extinguished earlier that evening, from 
        the sacred bonfire to help protect them during the coming winter.</p>

        <h1>10 Interesting Facts About Halloween</h1>
        <ol class="number">
            <li>Halloween happens every evening of the 31st of October. <b>It marks the start of Allhallowtide, a series of 
                Christian holidays</b> meant to remember the dead such as loved ones, saints, and martyrs.</li>
            <li><b>Current Halloween customs</b> can be traced to the pagan traditions of ancient Celtics, particularly the 
                festival called &quotSamhain&quot which means summer&#39s end. It is part of their preparation for 
                the gloomy winter.</li>
            <li>Celtics believed that the boundary with the Otherworld is weaker during Samhain, allowing spirits 
                to pass through and walk among us. <b>People left food offerings outside their homes to appease the 
                spirits.</b></li>
            <li>By the 1500s, the festival began to include costumes and house-to-house visits. Young people 
                impersonated the spirits, recited verses, and sang songs in exchange for food. Households obliged 
                to receive good fortune</li>
            <li>Most celebrations of saints and martyrs were held from spring to summer. In 837, Pope Gregory 
                IV moved All Saints Day to November 1 which coincides with Samhain. <b>This was a practical 
                decision to decongest Rome from pilgrims during summers.</b></li>
            <li>In the Middle Ages, Christians would carry carved out turnips turned into lanterns while 
                going around homes for traditional souling. These lanterns are thought to symbolize 
                the souls of the dead.</li>

            <li>Pets are part of the family so they can&#39st be left behind. <b>In 2018, Americans collectively 
                spent roughly $480 million on Halloween costumes for their pets.</b> It is a massive increase 
                from the $200 million estimate back in 2010.</li>
            <li>The <b>first Halloween-themed attraction opened in 1915 in <font color="red">England</font>.</b>
